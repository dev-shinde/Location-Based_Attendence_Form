Project Structure
The project can be structured into the following key components:

1. User Interface
The user interface component involves creating a web-based form or application that allows users to mark their attendance. The form should be intuitive and easy to use, with options for users to enter their identification details (e.g., employee ID, student ID) and submit their attendance information. The interface can be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive layout that works on various devices.

2. Geolocation Integration
Geolocation integration is a crucial aspect of the project, as it enables the system to determine the user's current location. The project can utilize technologies such as GPS, Wi-Fi, or IP-based geolocation to obtain accurate location information. JavaScript libraries or APIs, such as the Geolocation API, can be employed to retrieve the user's coordinates (latitude and longitude) from their device.

3. Location Management
Location management involves defining and managing the designated attendance locations. The project should provide a mechanism for administrators to set up and maintain the list of valid attendance locations. These locations can be stored in a database or a configuration file, associating each location with a unique identifier and its corresponding geographic coordinates.

4. Attendance Tracking
The attendance tracking component is responsible for validating the user's location against the designated attendance locations. When a user submits their attendance through the form, the system compares their current location with the predefined locations to determine if they are within the allowed range. If the user's location matches one of the designated locations, their attendance is recorded; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
